Hey! This is neuron. It turns your chaotic notes and turns them into manageable and sorted chunks.

It's also pretty.

///////

You can add new pages with a bunch of "/", three will do, but go nuts it's ok, dont need to be careful

### How neuron works

Topics are three "#" in a row, they're like waypoint markers. You can use them to figure out what is where.

Of course everyone has TODO items. If you need a todo, you put it on a line like this

TODO This is a regular todo
TODO 3/14 this has a date, so it will probably float to the top
TODO WHATEVER is a neat way 
TODO WHATEVER to group todos, sorting and all you know

///////

### What about doing things

When you finish a todo just mark it done

TODO done I totally this is already

What about urgent stuff??

TODO urgent Find out how to make something urgent!

If you're gonna do it later?

TODO later I'll totally get to this sometime

We all love links, that was a link. You can drop em basically anywhere.

Only catch... they gotta be at the start of the line (for now), also they need the full address, not just www
https://www.canada.ca

### How do I find stuff

It's a plain static page, no fancy stuff. Except maybe materializecss which makes it pretty and the python in the bushes that makes it snappy.

Just use CTRL+F and type what you need. page, topic, etc. You'll get the hang of it.

What about all this "Line" stuff. You go into notepad and look at this notepad file youre reading. Then CTRL+G and type the line number. You should now be on that line. 

### How do I use it?

You need python. But if you have it just "python neuron.py neuron_this_example.txt"

And then neuron_this_example.html should pop out. Open that and you're good to go :)
