# neuron. built out of need

My notes were getting unruly. I take them while I code, on the phone, everywhere. Sometimes they're 
coming at me from every angle. TODOs, links I need, everything. Ends up in random text. Somewhere.
Weird file names, no idea whats inside. But all critical for something. I think.

Stop guessing. Start clearing your Brain.RAM. Use neuron to make sense of your notes.

# General Information

Built with Python, Materializecss, VSCode, and notepad. That's all folks!

It uses a basic syntax

```bash
////// for pages
TODO for todos
Three ### for topics
And you can put hyperlinks on their own link to add them to the registry
```

# Getting it Running

```bash
python neuron.py neuron_this_example.txt
```

You'll need python 3.5+, I used anaconda, but you're free to do what suits you.

# Notes

I got this running in my spare time out of need to figure out what I actually needed to do. And not lose track of any of it.

Sometimes to go fast, you must have a Technical Pit Stop
